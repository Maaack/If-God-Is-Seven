It reads, \"Mom, tomorrow marks one year since you left us,\"

\"Yes, I said it! I cursed you. I'm THAT mad at YOU!\"
\"Who are you to make me suffer like this? To put me through trials of Hell on Earth.\"
\"To HELL with YOU! You're worse than a majority of people!\"
\"I don't care if it dooms my soul. I dare you to come down here and strike me down.\"
\"I don't want to wake up tomorrow, anyway.\"
